        There is little to be gained when you worry about yourself, especially when there exists a community of people who believe 
        what you believe, looking after you. This newly found freedom from self-interest should provide you ample time and energy

         exceed them. If you fall short, own your failures, understand where you went wrong, and course correct. When you do inevitably 
         fail, fail fast, fail forward. Don’t focus on what others around you are doing or accomplishing, their accolades are theirs; 
         and they deserve them. Better, congratulate others for their wins and seek opportunities to help them accomplish more!`

       your failures encourages a culture where people are comfortable taking risks knowing everyone has their back. It also prevents other
        people from making the same mistake.
